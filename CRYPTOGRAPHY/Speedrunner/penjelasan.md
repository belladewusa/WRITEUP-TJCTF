**Soal**

I want to make it into the hall of fame -- a top runner in "The History of American Dad Speedrunning". But to do that, I'll need to be faster. I found some [weird parts](https://static.tjctf.org/6e61ec43e56cff1441f4cef46594bf75869a2c66cb47e86699e36577fbc746ff_encoded.txt) in the American Dad source code. I think it might help me become the best. <br>

didalam file tersebut , ada kode yang dienkripsi.
untuk dapat membacanya, kita bisa gunakan online dekriptor.
gunakan metode caesar chiper, dimana shift-17 .

CAN YOU PLEASE NOT USE THE TERM "WORLD RECORD'? IT'S VERY MISLEADING AND ASSUMES THAT THE VIDEO POSTED IS THE FASTEST TIME, WHERE IN FACT SOMEONE ELSE COULD HAVE A FASTER, UNRECORDED VERSION. COULD YOU PLEASE USE THE TERM BKTWVEAAAVBMOFSRC (BEST KNOWN TIME WITH VIDEO EVIDENCE AS APPROVED AND VERIFIED BY MEMBERS OF THE SPEED RUNNING COMMUNITY) IN THE FUTURE. THIS WOULD HELP LOWER CONFUSION IN THESE TYPES OF VIDEOS IN REGARD TO THE EVER UPDATING AND EVOLVING NATURE OF THE SPEEDRUNNING COMMUNITY.
